          Today I thought to write my thoughts
          For, every day I struggle
          I wake and rise, I drown in work
          I've little time for fable
          I'm disconnected from the way
          That I know life has ought to be
          A meditation here and there
          I don't know if I'll succeed
          What perfect path can I tread?
          Is there even structure? 
          To find for me the motivation
          That is what I wonder
