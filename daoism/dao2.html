        <per style="white-space: pre-line;" style="text-align: center;">When beauty is seen,
        It is seen because there is ugliness;
        When good is seen,
        It is seen because there is evil;¹</per>
        <p></p>
        <per style="white-space: pre-line;" style="text-align: center;">Something and nothing arise together;
        Difficult and easy complement each other;
        Long and short contrast each other;
        High and low complete each other; 
        Voice and soundᵃ harmonize each other;
        First and last follow each other;²</per>
        <p></p>
        <per style="white-space: pre-line;" style="text-align: center;">The sage acts without doing;
        Teaches without talking;
        Much rises from his acts,
        Yet he claims none;
        He creates, yet claims no possession;³
        He works, yet does not ask thanks;⁴
        He succeeds, yet claims no merit;⁵
        This is why his success shall last foreverᵇ.⁶</per>
        <p></p>
        <per style="white-space: pre-line;">¹ in reading this chapter, this opening was translated in two distinct ways; the general gist of both that I could figure out is that one cannot exist without the other; beauty is only beauty when contrasted with ugliness and vice versa; good is only good when contrasted with evil; this is meant to set up how the rest of this chapter is going to go
        ² everything in this section is about contrasts without placing one as better or worse than the other; a phrase in English is similar to this, "where there is light, there is shadow"; it's not a moral or value judgement, all of these are equal in importance and are relational to each other; none would make sense without the other
        ³ not that possession is inherently wrong, but that clinging to possession can hold you back when you need to let go; a sage knows when to let go and doesn't fret that he needs to
        ⁴ it's not that the sage isn't happy for gratitude, but he doesn't need it in order to labor for another; gratitude is a kind gesture for a job well done, but one would be stifled from doing anything if they sought out that gratitude
        ⁵ the sage may still sign his name on the back of a painting, but he would not fret of that name is never read, or even if his work is never seen; one should not revel in their success, grasping to it like it has become intrinsic to themselves; the sage does not need external recognition to recognize his own accomplishments
        ⁶ a bit of translation work is done here for the sake of English's limitations, but the general idea is that, if one is not attached to their accomplishments, they lose nothing when they're "taken"; not clinging to accomplishments means that if they're gone one has lost nothing as they never tried to claim possession of them; a true accomplishment will always be there, but a false accomplishment is no sweat if one was not invested in keeping it; it's not that success lasts forever, but that, when one does not cling to it, nothing is lost if it passes</per>
        <p></p>
        <per style="white-space: pre-line;">ᵃ the words used here are 音 (yīn), structured sound, and 聲 (shēng), audible emission, but these aren't clear in English what they are contrasting, so such a translation is tentative; I chose this translation simply out of personal preference; given the ways they can translate, I would hazard a guess that it's about emotive sound, without care for structure, being more free-form, as opposed to more structured and rigid sound, with care taken for timing and key; as a musician, I can understand this contrast, if that's what's meant, as I'm more free-form and, without a meditating presence, I have a hard time playing with someone who likes to follow a metronome, we often can't line up without something to keep us both on the same track; 音 (yīn) also conceptually derives from 聲 (shēng), where 聲 (shēng) is any sound, 音 (yīn) is structured and musical, so this relates back to Chapter 1's idea of two from one
        ᵇ the term is 不去 (bù qù) meaning "does not leave", often translated as "forever"; it's not about a time frame, it's more experiential and relational</per>

        This one became rather difficult - not only thanks to what was pointed out with first section, but also with the last line. It took trial and error and reading multiple transcriptions to understand these things, but I eventually figured it out (I hope). This is basically demonstrating the logic behind yin and yang, duality that complements each other. In western cosmology, contrasts are often moralized - it's what led to depictions of yin and yang in such ways as Korra's depiction of Vaatu and Raava (which I had always found disrespectful to the Eastern philosophy that Avatar the Last Airbender had shown such appreciation for). But this dualistic framing would be doing a disservice to Laozi and other daoist philosophers. A big part of this chapter seems to be both acknowledging the contrasts and complements of things and refusing the idea that any of them should be clung to. The sage is marked not by asceticism or abstaination, but rather by ability to let go of things when he needs to. Admittedly, something I always struggle with.</p>
