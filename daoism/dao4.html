        <per style="white-space: pre-line;">¹ the use referred to here is about the ways the Dao manifests in the world, not active use by some practitioner of mysticism 
        ² this suggests that the Dao is ever infinite, ever extant; no matter the manifestations of it, it is never filled, like an infinitely deep bowl
        ³ it's so vastly infinite, composed of infinite potential and possibility, that it's like all things came from it; yet I think it would be a mistake to interpret it as simply a source of divine creation, as the Dao is more a process than a divinity; "all things coming from it" would be similar to saying "all men came from evolution", which is technically true but fails to grasp the wholeness of what that entails
        ⁴ this idea of the Dao uniting with the mundane world seems to suggest that the natural state of the world is to flow without resistance, rather than a conscious entity actively merging with the universe; eventually, one way or another, everything aligns with the Dao, in effortless action and tranquility
        ⁵ all of these entail a direction of negentropy, a movement towards order and peace rather than disorder and chaos; at the same time, entropy can be thought of in the same way, where the degradation and unraveling of all can also result in order and peace
        ⁶ an expression of awe at the vastness of the Dao</per>
        <p></p>
        <per style="white-space: pre-line;">ᵃ the word used is 沖 (chōng) which can also mean "flowing" or "primordial", suggesting infinite potential
        ᵇ the term 淵 (yuān) can be translated as "deep", "abyss", or "primordial source", suggesting great mystery; it can also suggest that all comes from it, and in a way that can be true, but not so directly birthed like the concept of divinity creating all life
        ᶜ the word here 銳 (ruì) can also be translated as "aggressiveness"
        ᵈ the term 同 (tóng) suggests "becoming one" rather than a simple mixing of things
        ᵉ the word 塵 (chén) can also be translated as "all that is ordinary" and, more interestingly to me, "dust", suggesting the most vast joining with the most insignificant
        ᶠ this one is different from the earlier instance of "deep", using the word 湛 (zhàn) instead, meaning "clear" or "profound"
        ᵍ the word 存 (cún) means "exist", "remain", or "be preserved"; in later versions, influenced by Chinese cosmology, the term used is 帝 (dì), at the time referring to the creator god, but this is more of a later syncretism so I chose to use 存 instead</per>

        This is the first chapter which really delves into what the Dao actually "is" - and it does so without actually defining it. It presents the Dao as the source of all things, and I read this more as it leads to all things being, as it is the process by which things act and don't act, the fundamental principle, not a divinity. The attempt to sneak divinity into this is often translated as saying that the Dao came before divinity, thus still separating the idea of divinity from the Dao. We get a glimpse of what the Dao is, and it's so vast that no description can do it justice as to what it truly is (even my analogy to evolution is flawed - as we basically understand how evolution works). </p>
