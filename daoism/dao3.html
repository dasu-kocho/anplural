                <per style="white-space: pre-line; text-align: center;">Not exalting great men
                Prevents quarreling;
                Not parading treasures
                Prevents coveting;
                Not gloating of great thingsᵃ
                Prevents troubling;¹</per>

                <per style="white-space: pre-line; text-align: center;">Therefore the Sage leadsᵇ thus:
                Empties his heartᶜ,²
                Fills his gut,³
                Weakens his ambitions,⁴
                Strengthens his bonesᵈ;⁵
                He does not tempt with knowledge
                And thus does not grow theirᵉ desires;⁶</per>
                <p></p>
                <per style="white-space: pre-line; text-align: center;">Practice effortless action
                And all falls into place.⁷</per>

        <per style="white-space: pre-line;">¹ a theme between these is the idea of one's decisions causing envy, just envy in various forms; the first form is the envy for recognition, the section is envy for what another possesses, and the third is envy for what they cannot hope to possess; all this envy just causes issues, from quarrels, to thievery, to anxiety
        ² to be able to let go of desires
        ³ to be satisfied with what one has
        ⁴ to not strive too hard to force the outcome
        ⁵ to be strong in place where one needs to stand, firm and shaped by the ever changing currents that erode the unworked stone into something polished
        ⁶ one's choices affect others, bringing up envy, that desire to have what one doesn't; knowledge isn't what's bad, it's the weaponizing of specific knowledge causing others to lose their sense of contentment with their way that is
        ⁷ that is to say that when you don't force a specific outcome, when you don't grasp to a vision too tightly, things fall into order and harmonize</per>
        <p></p>
        <per style="white-space: pre-line;">ᵃ this is actually an abstraction of what many translators often show as explicit acts such as "displaying what is desirable" or "showing rare treasures"; to me, these sound like it's about showing off or "gloating" about what one possesses
        ᵇ the term 治 (zhì) is often translated and read more bureaucratically, but I chose "to lead" to remove it from this and back to the idea of creating order from disorder; it also appears at the end of the chapter, showing that it's less about politics and domination and more about harmonization
        ᶜ the term 心 (xin) means "heart-mind" and is more often translated in this chapter as "mind" or something else related to "knowledge", making it sound more anti-intellectual than it really is
        ᵈ the term 骨 (gu), meaning "bones", was translated by Stephen Mitchell into "resolve", replacing its structural meaning with something more directional, losing its metaphoric capacity in favor of a distinct reading
        ᵉ in classical Chinese, the term 其 (qi) can be referring inwardly to the sage or outwardly to those the sage would lead; my decision to translate the first part of the section as "his" and the last one to "theirs" is that the conditions for order begin inward, not outward; a sage cannot hope to unburden others of that which he is burdened</per>

        <per style="white-space: pre-line;">Comments
        Overall, this chapter is rather straightforward: don't be a braggart, it doesn't help anyone and can cause more harm than not. Constructing social fields centered around comparison creates unnecessary tension.</p>
